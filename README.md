# Ensemble Averaging in Simultaneous and Sequential Lineups

**Does the presentation format of a police lineup (sequentially vs simultaneously) influence how people extract shared information and make recognition decisions?**  

This project investigates how *ensemble perception* impacts eyewitness discriminability based on lineup presentation formats, drawing on cognitive modeling and signal detection theory.

## Project Overview

In eyewitness research, **simultaneous lineups** (where all faces are viewed at once) often yield better identification accuracy than **sequential lineups** (one face at a time). This project tests a core assumption of the **Ensemble Model**—that simultaneous presentation enhances the precision of *ensemble representations* (i.e., an average face formed from multiple similar ones), which in turn supports better memory discrimination.

I examined whether the ability to distinguish an "old" (studied) average face from a "new" (unstudied) one is better when study faces are encoded simultaneously versus sequentially.

## Experiments & R Code

Across **four experiments**, participants studied sets of six faces either:
- **Simultaneously** (all at once)
- **Sequentially** (one at a time)

Then they were asked to discriminate between an *ensemble morph* created from the studied faces and a morph created from similar but unstudied faces.

- **Experiment 1**: Original In-person Study 
- **Experiment 2**: Online Study 
- **Experiment 3a**: In-person Replication 1
- **Experiment 3b**: In-person Replication 2
- **Internal Meta Analysis**

### Analysis Method
- Calculation of **Hit Rates**, **False Alarm Rates**, and **Adjusted Discirminability**
- Calculation of **Cohen's d**, ***t*-value**, and ***p*-value** comparing across conditions (Null Hypothesis Significance Testing)

## Impact Statement

Our ability to summarize information quickly is a core feature of visual cognition. When systems present information sequentially rather than simultaneously, they place a burden on working memory, impairing our ability to detect meaningful patterns.

These findings inform real-world design problems in **interface layouts**, **visual recognition systems**, and **AI-supported identification tools**, particularly in high-stakes settings like legal decision-making, security screening, or medical diagnostics.

## Key Findings

- **Simultaneous presentation** improves ensemble morph discriminability.
- **Sequential presentation** degrades ensemble quality—likely due to working memory load and lack of parallel comparison.
- The ensemble representation acts as a *summary signal*, and its precision depends critically on how the visual input is encoded.

These findings provide **experimental support for the Ensemble Model**, advancing our understanding of collective memory signals in decision-making.

## UX Implication

This project intersects directly with core UX research principles around **information architecture** and **visual cognition**. Specifically, it addresses:

- How **presentation format** impacts memory, attention, and choice
- The tradeoffs between **serial vs. parallel processing** in visual workflows
- Strategies for minimizing **cognitive load** during perceptual decision-making

For UX researchers and designers, it offers cognitive grounding for **why grouping similar elements** together may enhance perception, while separating them temporally may introduce noise.

## Theoretical Implication

Simultaneous formats promote better *ensemble averaging*, which enhances discriminability by highlighting **diagnostic facial features**.  
Sequential formats interfere with this process, possibly due to:
- Increased working memory burden
- Interruptions in comparison processes
- Decreased salience of shared traits across items

These results support a core assumption of **diagnostic feature detection theory** and reinforce ensemble perception as a **mechanism of attention guidance** in memory-based decisions.
